# Understand the devbox.json file

Okay, let's see where the magic is done: the `devbox.json`{{}} file. Make sure you are in the correct folder using `ls`{{exec}}, and then, simply open it using `nano devbox.json`{{exec}}. 

This file was generated by DevBox. Let's look at what there is on the file.

In the `"packages"`{{}} key we can put all the packages we want the environment to have by default. We see that we have chosen to have the latest version of python. 

In the `"shell"`{{}} key we have all the scripts: (the ones run when initializing the environment (`"init_hooks"`{{}}) and the rest, which are run when we call them (`"scripts"`{{}})). We see that we have chosen to start also the python virtual environment (which is something different) right away. We can also see how the `py`{{}} script is defined: it is a list of strings, where each string is one line of a bash script. This way, we can check that if the application was not installed, we had to do it (reduce manual labour), and afterwards actually run the application like we tried to do at the beggining of the tutorial. Isn't it beautiful?

So now that we understand the devbox.json file, let's actually check the python versions inside and outside the environment:

Just remember to exit nano with ctrl+X before executing the commands.

Now we are actually outside of the environment, since when you execute a script devbox just has it open for that. So let's see again the python version here:

```bash
python --version
```{{exec}}

Oh, what a surprise, it has not changed.
Let's go inside of the DevBox environment and look at the python version again:

```bash
devbox shell
python --version
```{{exec}}

We can actually see that the version is 3.12. It worked! 

Now we can exit the shell again with the command `exit`{{exec}}.

Okay, let's continue! Now you will have to do a bit more than just executing commands.
