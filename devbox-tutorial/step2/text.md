# Trying DevBox

To create virtual environments, we are going to use DevBox. Before you read how it works, lets install it, so we don't have to wait afterwards:

```Bash
curl -fsSL https://get.jetify.com/devbox
```{{exec}}

Remember to say yes to the installation!

Let's run the code now using the DevBox command! Again, first we execute, then we explain, because this one will take 2-3 minutes.

```Bash
cd /app
devbox run py
```{{exec}}

Again, remember to enter so the installation of the requirements start. 

Okay, so you might have a lot of questions of what we have actually done now. Why didn't we have to install the requirements? What is this command we just executed? Where is it defined? What does it actually do?

To answer all of this questions, we would like to show you the file where it's defined, but  we have to wait for the installation of the requirements and the execution of the program, lets try to understand it before looking at it.

DevBox is not just a simple package manager for your projects. You can also create custom scripts that can be triggered with commands similar to having a makefile. In addition, you can already choose to have scripts run when you initialize the environment. This way, you save time and you just have to know the name of your script in order to run it.

Now, in case it hasn't finished, lets wait, and when it's done, you will see that the FastAPI CLI is active. So, to
