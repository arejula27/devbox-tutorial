# Create your own script
Explain the user how to create a script in devbox.json and how to run it. The step should chek if the script is working. 
For example the check.sh should be `devbox run venv` and it will create in case it does not exist a python virtual environment and then activate it. The user should be able to copy paste the script (write the whole command in this file).
