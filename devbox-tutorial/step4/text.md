# Create your own script, part 1

Did you get how the devbox.json file works? Because now we want to create a new custom script! We want it to be called `test`, and the script is just the command `pytest`. So remember that what we want is to be able to write `devbox run test`, and that actually we are running `pytest` (with the init hooks also being run). 

If you think you know how to do it, go ahead. If you need an extra help, go to the next step and there you can see how it's done.
