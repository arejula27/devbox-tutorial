# Create your own script, part 1

Did you understand how the `devbox.json` file works? Because now we want to create a new custom script! We want it to be called `test`, and the script should simply run the `pytest` command. This means we want to be able to type `devbox run test`, and in reality, we are running `pytest` (with the init hooks also being run).

If you think you know how to do it, go ahead. If you need some extra help, go to the next step, where you can see how itâ€™s done.
